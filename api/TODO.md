# What's left
- [ ] Registration and base login structure
- [ ] Cookie based session persistence
    - [ ] Auto expiration, only remove on verification
- [ ] Proper field validation for registration
    - [ ] Check presence of all fields 
    - [ ] *Maybe* validate certains good practices (size, non repetitive or obvious)
- [ ] Reorganize it?
    - Maybe throw all authentication related handlers in an ~~auth~~ **handlers** package
