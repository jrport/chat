# What's left
- [x] Registration and base login structure
- [x] Cookie based session persistence
    - [x] Auto expiration, only remove on verification
- [x] Proper field validation for registration
    - [x] Check presence of all fields 
    - [ ] *Maybe* validate certains good practices (size, non repetitive or obvious)
- [ ] Reorganize it?
    - Maybe throw all authentication related handlers in an ~~auth~~ **handlers** package
